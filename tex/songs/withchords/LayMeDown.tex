\beginverse
\[E]Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
\[A]And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars, are nothing without you
Your \[E]touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way i'm missing you
\[A]Deny this emptiness, this hole that i'm inside
\[A]These tears, they tell their own story
You \[F#m]told me not to \[A]cry when you were \[C#m]gone \[B]
But the \[F#m]feeling's over\[A]whelming, it's much to\[E]o strong\[B]
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[E]Can I lay by your s\[C#m]ide, next to \[F#m]you, \[A]you
And \[E]make sure you're alrig\[C#m]ht
I'll take \[F#m]care of you,
And I \[A]don't want to be here if \[B]I can't be with you \[E]tonight
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[E]I'm reaching out to you
\[A]Can you hear my call
\[E]This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like \[A]crazy
You \[F#m]told me not to \[A]cry when you were \[E]gone \[B]
But the \[F#m]feeling's over\[A]whelming, it's much to\[E]o strong\[B]
\endverse

\beginchorus

And I \[A]don't want to be here if \[B]I can't be with you \[E]tonight
