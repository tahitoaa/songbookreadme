\beginverse
\[F]Saturday \[G]mornin', jumped out of \[C]bed
And \[Am]put on my best suit
\[F]Got in my \[G]car and raced like a \[C]jet
\[Am]All the way to you
\[F]Knocked on your \[G]door with heart in my \[C]hand
To \[Am]ask you a question
'\[F]Cause I know that \[G]you're an old fashioned \[C]man
\[Am]Yeah (yeah)
\endverse

^Can I have your daughter for the ^rest of my life?
Say ^yes, say yes, 'cause I ^need to know
You say I'll ^never get your blessin' 'til the ^day I die
"Tough ^luck, my friend, but the ans^wer is no"
\endverse

\beginchorus
^Why you gotta be so ^rude?
^Don't you know I'm hum^an too?
