\[G]
I found a \[G]love for \[Em]me
Darling, just \[C]dive right in, and follow my \[D]lead
Well, I found a \[G]girl beaut\[Em]iful and sweet
I never \[C]knew you were the one waiting for \[D]me
Cause we were just kids when we \[G]fell in love
Not knowing \[Em]what it was,
I will not \[C]give you up this \[G]ti-\[D]ime
Darling just \[G]kiss me slow, your heart is \[Em]all I own
And in your \[C]eyes you're holding mi\[D]ne
\endverse

Baby, \[Em]I'm d\[C]ancing in the \[G]dark,
with \[D]you between my \[Em]arms
\[C]Barefoot on the g\[G]rass, \[D]listening to our \[Em]favorite song
When you s\[C]aid you looked a \[G]mess,
I whispered \[D]underneath my b\[Em]reath
But you h\[C]eard it, darling \[G]you look \[D]perfect tonig\[G]ht

\beginverse
Well, I found a \[G]woman, stronger than \[Em]anyone I know
She shares my \[C]dreams,
I hope that someday I'll share her \[D]home
I found a l\[G]ove, to carry \[Em]more than just my secrets
To carry \[C]love, to carry children of our \[D]own
We are still kids but we're \[G]so in love,
fighting a\[Em]gainst all odds
I know we'll \[C]be all right this \[G]ti-\[D]ime
Darling just \[G]hold my hand, be my girl,
I'll \[Em]be your man
I see my \[C]future in your e\[D]yes

Baby, \[Em]I'm d\[C]ancing in the d\[G]ark,
with \[D]you between my \[Em]arms
\[C]Barefoot on the g\[G]rass, \[D]listening to our \[Em]favorite song
When I \[C]saw you in that d\[G]ress, looking so b\[D]eautiful
I \[Em]don't des\[C]erve this, darling \[G]you look \[D]perfect tonig\[G]ht
