^Tap on my window ^knock on my door
^I want to make you feel ^beautiful
^I knom I tend to get ^so insecure
^It doesn't matter ^anymore
^It's not only ^rainbows and butterfly
It's ^compromise that moves us ^along
My ^heart is full and my ^door is always open
You can ^come anytime you ^want
\endverse

^I know where you hide
^Alone in your car
^Know all of the things
^that make you who you are
^I know that goodbye means nothing at all
^Comes back and begs me
To ^catch her everytime she falls\[F]
