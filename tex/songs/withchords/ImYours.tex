\beginverse
Well \[G]you done done me and you bet I felt it
I \[D]tried to be chill
But you're so hot that I melted
I \[Em]fell right through the cracks
And now I'm \[C]trying to get back
Before the \[G]cool done run out,
I'll be giving it my bestest
And \[D]nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I \[Em]reckon it's again my turn
To \[C]win some or learn some
\endverse

\beginchorus
But \[G]I won't hesi\[D]tate
No more, no \[Em]more
It cannot \[C]wait, I'm you\[G]rs \[D] \[Em] \[C]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G]Well, open up your mind and see like \[D]me
Open up your plans and damn you're \[Em]free
Look into your heart and you'll find \[C]love,
Love, love, love
\[G]Listen to the music of the moment
People dance \[D]and sing, we're just one big fami\[Em]ly
And it's our god-forsaken right to be \[C]loved,
Loved, loved, loved, \[A7]loved
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]So I won't hesi\[D]tat\[Dsus4]e
No more, no \[Em]more
It cannot \[C]wait, I'm sure
There's no \[G]need to compli\[D]cate
Our time is \[Em]short
This is our \[C]fate
I'm yours \[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G]Doo do do doo doo do, \[D]doo do doo do \[Em]doo do
Do you want to come on, 
\[D] Scooch on over \[C]closer, dear
And I will nibble your \[A7]ear
\[G Bm | Em D | C  | A7 ]
I've been spending \[G]way too long
Checking my tongue in the mirror
And \[D]bending over backwards 
Just to try to see it clearer
But \[Em]my breath fogged up the glass
And so I \[C]drew a new face and I laughed
I \[G]guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To \[D]rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It'\[Em]s what we aim to do
Our \[C]name is our virtue
\endverse

\beginchorus
But \[G]I won't hesi\[D]ta\[Dsus4]te
No more, no \[Em]more
It cannot \[C]wait, I'm you\[G]rs
Well, open up your mind and see like \[D]me
Open up your \[D]plans and damn you're f\[Em]ree
Look into your heart
And you'll find that \[C] the sky is yours
So \[G]please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no \[D]need to c\[Dsus4]omplicate
Cause our \[Em]time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our \[C]fate
I'm your\[A7]s
\endchorus
