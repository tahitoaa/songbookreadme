\beginverse
\[C]A long long time ago
\[G7]There was a volcano
\[F]Living all alone in the \[C]middle of the \[G7]sea
\[C]He sat high above his bay
\[G7]Watching all the couples play
\[F]And wishing that \[C]he had someone \[G7]too
\[C]And from his lava came
\[G7]This song of hope that he sang out \[F]loud
Every day
\[C]For years and \[G7]years
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]I have a dream
I \[C]hope it will come true
That \[D]you're here with me
And \[G7]I am here with you
I \[F]wish that the earth, sea, and the \[C]sky up above
Will \[F]send me \[G7]someone to \[C]lava
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Years of singing all alone
^Turned his lava into stone
Un^til he was on the ^brink of extin^ction
^But little did he know
That ^living in the sea below
Ano^ther volcano
Was ^listening to his ^song
^Everyday she heard his tune
^Her lava grew and grew
Be^cause she believed his ^song was meant for ^her
^Now she was so ready to ^meet him above the sea
As he ^sang his song of hope ^for the last ^time
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]I have a dream
I \[C]hope it will come true
That \[D]you're here with me
And \[G7]I am here with you
I \[F]wish that the earth, sea, and the \[C]sky up above
Will \[F]send me \[G7]someone to \[C]lava
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Rising from the sea below
^Stood a lovely volcano
^Looking all around
But ^she could not see ^him
^He tried to sing to let her know
That ^she was not there alone
But ^with no lava, his ^song was all ^gone
^He filled the sea with his tears
^Watched his dreams disappear
As ^she remembered what his ^song meant to ^her
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]I have a dream
I \[C]hope it will come true
That \[D]you're here with me
And \[G7]I am here with you
I \[F]wish that the earth, sea, and the \[C]sky up above
Will \[F]send me \[G7]someone to \[C]lava
\endchorus

\beginverse
^Oh they were so happy
To ^finally meet above the sea
^All together now their ^lava grew and ^grew
^No longer are they all alone
With ^Aloha as their new home
^And when you go and visit them ^this is what they ^sing
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]I have a dream
I \[C]hope it will come true
That \[D]you will grow old with me
And \[G7]I will grow old with you
\[F]We thank the earth, sea, and \[C]the sky we thank too
\[F]I \[G7]lava you\[C]you
\[F]I \[G7]lava you\[C]you
\[F]I \[G7]lava you\[C]you
\endchorus`
