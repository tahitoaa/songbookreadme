\beginverse
\[Bm]The club isn't the best p\[Em]lace to find a lover,
So the b\[G]ar is where I \[A]go
\[Bm]Me and my friends at the \[Em]table doing shots,
Drinking f\[G]ast and then we talk sl\[A]ow
Come \[Bm]over and start up a conver\[Em]sation with just me
And t\[G]rust me, I'll give it a ch\[A]ance now
Take my \[Bm]hand, stop!
Put Van the \[Em]man on the jukebox and t\[G]hen we start to d\[A]ance
And now I'm singing like
\[Bm]Girl you know I \[Em]want your love
\[G]Your love was handmade f\[A]or somebody like \[Bm]me
Come on now, \[Em]follow my lead
\[G]I may be crazy, \[A]don't mind me, say
\[Bm]Boy, let's not \[Em]talk too much
\[G]Grab on my waist and \[A]put that body on \[Bm]me
Come on now, \[Em]follow my lead
Co\[G]me-come on now, follow my lead
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Bm] I'm in \[Em]love with the shape of \[G]you
We push and p\[A]ull like a magnet \[Bm]do
Although my \[Em]heart is falling \[G]too
I'm in l\[A]ove with your body
\[Bm] And last n\[Em]ight you were in my r\[G]oom
And now my \[A]bedsheets smell like \[Bm]you
Everyday discove\[Em]ring something brand \[G]new
Well I'm in l\[A]ove with your body
\[Bm](Oh \[Em]I)\[G] I'm in \[A]love with your body
\[Bm](Oh \[Em]I)\[G] I'm in \[A]love with your body
\[Bm](Oh \[Em]I)\[G] I'm in \[A]love with your body
\[Bm] Everyday discove\[Em]ring something brand n\[G]ew
I'm in l\[A]ove with the shape of you
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Bm]One week in, we let the \[Em]story begin
We're going \[G]out on our first \[A]date
But you and \[Bm]me are thrifty so go \[Em]all you can eat
Fill up your \[G]bag and I fill up a \[A]plate
We talk for \[Bm]hours and hours about the \[Em]sweet and sour
And how your \[G]family is doin' o\[A]kay
And leave and \[Bm]get in a taxi, we \[Em]kiss in the backseat
Tell the d\[G]river make the radio p\[A]lay
And I'm singing like
\[Bm]Girl you know I \[Em]want your love
\[G]Your love was handmade f\[A]or somebody like \[Bm]me
Come on now, \[Em]follow my lead
\[G]I may be crazy, \[A]don't mind me, say
\[Bm]Boy, let's not \[Em]talk too much
\[G]Grab on my waist and \[A]put that body on \[Bm]me
Come on now, \[Em]follow my lead
Co\[G]me-come on now, follow my lead
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Bm] I'm in \[Em]love with the shape of \[G]you
We push and p\[A]ull like a magnet \[Bm]do
Although my h\[Em]eart is falling \[G]too
I'm in l\[A]ove with your body \[Bm]
And last \[Em]night you were in my \[G]room
And now my \[A]bedsheets smell like \[Bm]you
Everyday discove\[Em]ring something brand \[G]new
Well I'm in l\[A]ove with your body \[Bm]
\[Bm](Oh \[Em]I)\[G] I'm in \[A]love with your body
\[Bm](Oh \[Em]I)\[G] I'm in \[A]love with your body
\[Bm](Oh \[Em]I)\[G] I'm in \[A]love with your body
\[Bm] Everyday discove\[Em]ring something brand n\[G]ew
I'm in l\[A]ove with the shape of you
\endchorus

\beginverse

\[G] Come on, be my \[A]baby, come on
